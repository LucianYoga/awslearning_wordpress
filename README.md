Slightly different approach; using the work done by someone else and build on that. I have created two files and named it differently so that you can easily see it. You can copy those two files in different folder and create a .tfvars file to put in key values and the project name. 
Then run 
terraform get
terraform plan

WE can also read the modules from mercurial, HTTP and file path besides git.
